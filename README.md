# Shimeji_v2.2.2
Shimeji for Windows/Mac/Linux. Onimaru Kazumi.

What is it?:
<p>It's a Shimeji! Or, if you prefer, it's a desktop buddy! Specifically, it is of Onimaru Kazumi, but it can be customized to be any character!
The download includes the versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux (I cannot guarantee that it works for all distributions, sorry >_<)

How to use:
<p>Run the executable file by clicking on it or run the .sh file in Linux by opening the command line and navigating to the appropriate folder with the "cd" command and run the .sh file with the command "./ShimejiKazumi.sh"
It might take a couple seconds to start up, so please be patient.
If it doesn't work please feel free to message me on Tumblr, username is CoveAlnazar there too.
After starting, Kazumi will walk, run, and jump around the edges of your screen. You can also drag him around by clicking and holding while moving the mouse.
Unlike a typical Shimeji, he will NOT grab your windows and throw them around. He's a good boy. Though I might add that functionality later if people really want it. (or you can add it yourself if you'd like)
He also doesn't clone himself.
Most of the kinks have been worked out (I think), but he does occasionally get confused/stuck. If this happens, just click and hold on him and drag him for a moment. When you let go, he should be back to normal.
You can close him by right-clicking on him and selecting "Quit" from the menu that pops up or by finding him in your process manager and ending his process, he should show up as "ShimejiKazumi.

How to customize:
<p>You'll need the free program "Godot".
Open the included project file "project.godot" from within the folder "shimeji_v2.2.2" with Godot.
Replace the images in the "img" folder with your own, keeping the names the same.
Feel free to mess with the code while you're in there!
Then export to your chosen operating system.

Can I share it?:
<p>Sure! Just don't sell it!
I'd like for anyone who wants to use it to be able to!
You can share the base version or any customized version!

Short version of the license?:
<p>Basically, do not sell any version of this software, and if you share it, customized or not, credit me as CoveAlnazar.
